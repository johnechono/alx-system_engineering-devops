## Postmortem

##Issue Summary:

Duration: The server outage occurred from 10:00am to 12:00pm (timezone: UTC +1).

##Impact:

The outage affected our online store service, resulting in a 30% decrease in user access. Users experienced slow page loading times and, in some cases, inability to complete purchases.

##Root Cause:

The root cause of the outage was a database server failure due to an unexpected surge in traffic, leading to resource exhaustion.

##Timeline:

Detection Time: The issue was detected at [Detection Time] when monitoring alerts signaled a spike in server load.

Detection Method: Monitoring alerts triggered when the server load exceeded predefined thresholds.

Actions Taken: The engineering team investigated the issue by examining server logs, analyzing traffic patterns, and checking the database’s health. Initially, the assumption was that a DDoS attack might be the cause.

Misleading Paths: There were misleading investigations into possible DDoS attacks and code-level issues that could be causing the server overload.

Escalation: The incident was escalated to the DevOps and Database teams to collaborate on resolving the issue.

Resolution: The incident was resolved by optimizing the database queries, scaling the database infrastructure, and implementing caching mechanisms to handle the increased load. The database server was also fine-tuned for better performance.

##Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause: The root cause was the unexpected surge in traffic generated by a successful online marketing campaign. The database server was not adequately prepared for handling such a rapid increase in concurrent connections and queries, leading to resource exhaustion and a subsequent crash.

Resolution: To address the issue, we took the following steps:

Optimized Database Queries: The DevOps team worked on optimizing database queries to reduce the server load and query execution time.

Scaling Infrastructure: The Database team implemented horizontal scaling by adding more database servers to distribute the load evenly.

Caching Mechanisms: We introduced caching mechanisms to serve frequently requested data from memory, reducing the need for repeated database queries.

Database Fine-Tuning: We fine-tuned the database server configuration, adjusting parameters to accommodate higher connection limits and query throughput.

##Corrective and Preventative Measures:

To prevent similar incidents in the future, we will:

Implement Auto-Scaling: Set up auto-scaling policies to dynamically adjust resources based on traffic spikes.

Enhance Monitoring: Add more comprehensive monitoring to detect unusual traffic patterns and provide real-time visibility into system health.

Code Optimization: Continuously optimize our application code to reduce the number and complexity of database queries.

Disaster Recovery Plan: Develop a comprehensive disaster recovery plan to quickly recover from unforeseen issues.

Regular Load Testing: Perform load testing to simulate traffic surges and ensure our systems can handle increased loads effectively.

Documentation: Document the incident, including the root cause, actions taken, and resolutions, for future reference.

In conclusion, the outage stemmed from unexpected traffic spikes due to a successful marketing campaign. By implementing the outlined corrective and preventative measures, we aim to fortify our system’s resilience and ensure the smooth operation of our services even during traffic surges.
